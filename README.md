# Welcome to state.js

The current stable release is 1.2.5.

## Introduction
State.js is a JavaScript implementation of a state machine library that supports most of the UML 2 state machine semantics.

State.js provides a hierarchical state machine capable of managing orthogonal regions; a variety of pseudo state kinds are implemented including initial, shallow & deep history, choice, junction and entry & exit points. 

## Versioning
The versions are in the form {major}.{minor}.{build}
* Major changes introduce significant new behaviour and will update the public API.
* Minor changes introduce features, bug fixes, etc, but note that they also may break the public API.
* Build changes can introduce features, though usually are fixes and performance enhancements; these will never break the public API.
